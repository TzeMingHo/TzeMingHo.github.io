                <p class="things-to-see">The <strong> monk parakeet </strong> (Myiopsitta monachus), also known as the <strong> monk parrot </strong> or <strong> Quaker parrot </strong>, is a species of true parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is a small, bright-green parrot with a greyish breast and greenish-yellow abdomen. Its average lifespan is approximately 15 years. It originates from the temperate to subtropical areas of South America. Self-sustaining feral populations occur in many places, mainly in areas of similar climate in North America and Europe.</p>

The work was interrupted from December 23, 1874, until October 10, 1875. It was inaugurated on June 11, 1876, with a traditional <em>corrida de toros</em>.</p>

            <p class="places-paragraph">The Alcazaba is a palatial fortification in Málaga, Spain, built during the period of Muslim-ruled Al-Andalus. The current complex was begun in the 11th century and was modified or rebuilt multiple times up to the 14th century. It is one of the best-preserved alcazabas in Spain. The Alcazaba is also connected by a walled corridor to the higher Castle of Gibralfaro, and adjacent to the entrance of the Alcazaba are remnants of a Roman theatre dating to the 1st century AD</p>
